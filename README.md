# Scholarships for pugs who talk like cats and are named after cupcakes

Welcome to a friendly code challenge.

Today we will be building an Ember app that will help to display information
about potential scholarship winners.

Judges will use this app to help them decided who will be awarded _the
scholarship_.

Here's a simple sketch of how it should look:

Again, to boil it down, we are starting by displaying the information that we
find at `/pugs` in a list.

## Technical Details

At `/pugs`, you will find a collection of pugs who talk like cats and are named
after cupcakes.

_/pugs_

* name
* photo
* bio

I have left a debugger on the application route `afterModel` so you can inspect
this for yourself. 

## Notes

* Don't feel like you have to focus that much on making this look fancy! You are
  free to drop in a CSS library or framework if you would like, but if you would
  rather just focus on building, that's great!

* This is not as much about execution as it is about process and problem
  solving!

* If you get stuck, feel free to use any references, resources, or materials that
  you would like. 

* There may be more to this challenge than is listed in this README. So please
  try to be quick. Feel free to skip writing tests or worrying about JSCS/JSHINT
  errors. üòÅ
